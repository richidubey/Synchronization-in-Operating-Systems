# Synchronization-in-Operating-Systems
Assignment for the course CS F372 Operating Systems Fall 2019 at BITS Pilani under Dr, Biju K Raveendran.


Note to juniors reading this: The OS assignments that we do at BITS Goa with Biju sir might seem really hard and tough at the time but it is nothing when compared to the things that students at top universities are doing (Undergrads are literally creating their own OS at UC Berkeley). Don't get me wrong, We cover a LOT of content when studying OS in our univ, and our assignments are complex and time consuming as well - but it can be even harder and we can learn even more - trust me. So, it makes absolutely no sense to just copy the code that you see here. It would be better to get a 0 on an assignment that you gave your full efforts to than get some marks (or full marks) from an assignment where you simply copied the code from someone's github repo. At the end of your 4 years, its not yours marks or CG that counts - its what you learnt and how you grew yourself as a person that matters. Please dont cheat.

The only reason I have put the code here is so that you can look at it after your assignemnt submission - to either see an alternative to your solution or figure out where you messed up.
